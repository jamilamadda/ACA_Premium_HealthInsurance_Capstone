##  Project Overview

This project analyzes how ACA health insurance premiums for young families in Tennessee have changed over time, how these changes compare to wage growth, and how geography, insurer choice, and plan structure combine to shape real affordability.

##  Motivation

My professional background as a dental office administrator involved working extensively with patient records, insurance claims and billing data. After moving to the United States, I personally experienced comparing different health insurance, analyzing premiums, coverage, and costs. These experiences inspired my capstone project, which applies data analytics to healthcare insurance data to explore cost patterns across plans and regions, supporting more informed decision-making for the consumers.. Ongoing national debate and renewed public attention around ObamaCare further underscores the relevance of examining how  these plans function in practice in this year of 2026.
